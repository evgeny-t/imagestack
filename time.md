ImageStack -help time


-time takes a sequence of commands, performs that sequence, and reports how
long it took. The commands that form the argument must be prefixed with an extra
dash. If given to arguments, it simply reports the time since the program was
launched. It is a useful operation for profiling.

Usage: ImageStack -load a.jpg -time --resample 10 10 --scale 2
