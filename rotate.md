ImageStack -help rotate


-rotate takes a number of degrees, and rotates every frame of the current image
clockwise by that angle. The rotation preserves the image size, filling empty
 areas with zeros, and throwing away data which will not fit in the bounds.

Usage: ImageStack -load a.tga -rotate 45 -save b.tga

```
